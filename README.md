# Farnsworth

Farnsworth is a tool to help in the creation and evaluation of programming
assignments.

To create an assignment, the instructor annotates the source code to mark
sections that students should not be allowed to see. When an archive of the
project is created, these sections will be removed. This might include
implementation or selected tests. Then, once students have completed the
assignment, some of those sections can be automatically merged back into each
project for evaluation (for instance, additional unit tests might be added).

This is a work-in-progress.
